1- There's no register functionality in the UI
2- There's no logout functionality in the UI
3- When password is incorrect in login it doesn't display anything
4- invalid password in registeration gives:
    ```
    {
    "status": "error",
    "message": "An internal server error occurred.",
    "error": {
        "code": 500,
        "details": "Please try again later."
        }
    }
    ```
5- Editing Thought functionality is not working
6- Deleting Thought functionality is not working
7- Serching functionality is not working
8- When I give a Thought a category_id it's not added to this category (What works is that 
    after I already add the Thought, i can update its categoryId, but I can't add it to a
    cateogry from the begining)
9- I don't want all thoughts to appear in the page so I'll have to fix search even for 
    getting all thoughts in dashboard
